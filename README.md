Spark Foundation Inc is a well renounded company. They have over 5000 employees all across the globe. Out of which we managed to accumlate data for 174 people (samle) on a random basis. We have data showing us their name, age, gender, nationality, ethenicity, tenure, department, department, position and annual salary. 

We are going to test if there is a significant difference in their salaries, based on gender. We will use hypothesis test for mean salaries to check for gender discrimination.
We will further analyze is there a race or age discrimination as well.

## Hypothesis Testing in Brief

All of the condition satisfies should satisfy to perform Student's T Test :

* Unknown Variance, since sample data and assumed to be equal
* dependant samples


__Process :__

1. Calucate n (sample size) for both dataset.
2. Standard Deviation
3. Pooled Variance
4. Standard Error 
5. Degree of freedom 
6. T Statistic Value 
7. Calculate P Value

Assess the p value to declare the reault.
